## 1. Describe a time you improved the performance of an infrastructure system.
**Context**: At WorkPay, I led the migration of their infrastructure from virtual machines to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The existing setup faced scalability issues and high operational overhead.

**Action**:
- Designed a Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling and load balancing.
- Implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform for consistent provisioning.
- Optimized CI/CD pipelines to support faster deployments.

**Result**:
- Reduced deployment times by 50%.
- Improved system scalability and reliability, supporting 10x traffic during peak usage.

## 2. How do you prioritize tasks when multiple urgent issues arise?
**Context**: While working at Plugin, I often encountered scenarios with simultaneous high-priority incidents, such as system outages and deployment failures.

**Approach**:
1. **Assess Impact**:
   - Evaluate the business impact of each issue (e.g., customer-facing outages take priority).
2. **Delegate**:
   - Assign tasks to team members based on their expertise.
3. **Communicate**:
   - Update stakeholders on timelines and progress to manage expectations.
4. **Iterate**:
   - Address issues iteratively, ensuring quick wins where possible.

**Example**:
- Resolved a production outage while simultaneously fixing CI pipeline issues by delegating tasks to teammates and automating deployment rollbacks.
