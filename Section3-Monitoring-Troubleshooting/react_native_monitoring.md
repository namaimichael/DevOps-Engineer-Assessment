# Monitoring React Native API Endpoints

## Context
Monitoring API endpoints for a React Native mobile app ensures high availability, reliability, and performance for end users. This document outlines the setup for monitoring key metrics and detecting issues.

## Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Latency**:
   - Measure response times for API endpoints.
   - Set alerts for requests exceeding a specific threshold.

2. **Error Rates**:
   - Track 4xx and 5xx response codes.
   - Identify patterns of failed requests.

3. **Throughput**:
   - Monitor the number of requests per second to ensure scalability.

4. **Availability**:
   - Check uptime of critical services and endpoints.

## Monitoring Setup
1. **Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - Export API metrics using Prometheus.
   - Visualize and set up alerts in Grafana.

2. **Synthetic Monitoring**:
   - Use tools like Postman or k6 to run scheduled tests on API endpoints.

3. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Implement OpenTelemetry or Jaeger for tracing requests across services.

## Example Prometheus Configuration
- Export metrics with a library like `express-prometheus-middleware`:
  ```javascript
  const prometheus = require('express-prometheus-middleware');

  app.use(prometheus({
      metricsPath: '/metrics',
      collectDefaultMetrics: true,
      requestDurationBuckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5],
  }));

## Alerts

**Example Grafana alert for high latency**

```
WHEN avg() OF query(A, 5m, now) > 500ms
