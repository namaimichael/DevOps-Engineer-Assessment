# Self-Healing Distributed Service

## Context
In distributed systems, failures are inevitable. A self-healing service automatically detects and resolves failures, ensuring high availability and reliability without human intervention.

## Key Concepts
1. **Health Checks**:
   - **Liveness Probe**: Ensures a service is running; restarts the service if it fails.
   - **Readiness Probe**: Ensures a service is ready to handle traffic.

2. **Retries and Timeouts**:
   - Retry transient failures with a configurable retry mechanism.
   - Set timeouts to avoid long wait times for unresponsive services.

3. **Circuit Breakers**:
   - Prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to unhealthy services.
   - Fallback mechanisms provide alternative solutions during failures.

4. **Auto-Scaling**:
   - Use horizontal pod autoscalers to handle increased traffic during recovery.
   - Scale down unused resources to save costs.

## Solution Design
1. **Kubernetes Setup**:
   - Define `liveness` and `readiness` probes in the deployment YAML.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     livenessProbe:
       httpGet:
         path: /healthz
         port: 8080
       initialDelaySeconds: 3
       periodSeconds: 10
     readinessProbe:
       httpGet:
         path: /readiness
         port: 8080
       initialDelaySeconds: 3
       periodSeconds: 10
     ```

2. **Service Mesh**:
   - Use Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic control:
     - Retry policies.
     - Circuit breakers.
     - Traffic shifting.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Use Prometheus to monitor application health.
   - Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization.
   - Automate alerts using tools like Alertmanager or PagerDuty.

## Example Workflow
1. Service crashes → Kubernetes restarts the service (via liveness probe).
2. Dependency fails → Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures.
3. Increased traffic → Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales up the service.

## Tools
- **Kubernetes**: For health checks and auto-scaling.
- **Istio/Linkerd**: For retries and circuit breaking.
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: For monitoring and alerting.

## Summary
Self-healing services minimize downtime and improve reliability by automating failure recovery. Combining Kubernetes health checks, service meshes, and monitoring tools ensures a resilient architecture.
